//! Credit score calculation and tier classification for the Tipz contract.
//!
//! For the complete credit score documentation including formula, weights, examples,
//! and update mechanisms, see [`docs/CREDIT_SCORE.md`](../../../docs/CREDIT_SCORE.md).
//!
//! ## Score range
//! All scores are in the range **0 – 100**.  Newly registered profiles start
//! at the base score of **40** (bottom of the Silver tier) because they
//! haven't yet built up tips, X presence, or account age.
//!
//! ## Formula
//! ```text
//! score = BASE_SCORE
//!       + tip_sub  * 20 / 100   (0-20 pts — tip volume component)
//!       + x_sub    * 30 / 100   (0-30 pts — X metrics component)
//!       + age_sub  * 10 / 100   (0-10 pts — account age component)
//!       + streak_bonus           (0-10 pts — streak bonus component, capped)
//!
//! capped at 100
//! ```
//!
//! Each *sub-score* is independently capped at 100 before weighting:
//!
//! | Sub-score  | Formula                                            | Cap |
//! |------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----|
//! | `tip_sub`  | `total_tips_received (stroops) / 10_000_000`       | 100 |
//! | `x_sub`    | `min(followers/50, 50) + min((posts+replies×1.5)/10, 50)` | 100 |
//! | `age_sub`  | `age_in_days / 10`  (0 when age < 1 day)          | 100 |
//! | `streak_bonus` | `sum of supporter streak milestones / 7`        | 10  |
//!
//! The streak bonus is *not* weighted; it is added after the weighted parts and
//! bounded by [`STREAK_BONUS_CAP`] so a long streak cannot dominate the other
//! signals. The total is clamped to [`MAX_SCORE`] regardless.
//!
//! ## Tier boundaries
//! | Tier    | Range   |
//! |---------|---------|
//! | New     | 0 – 19  |
//! | Bronze  | 20 – 39 |
//! | Silver  | 40 – 59 |
//! | Gold    | 60 – 79 |
//! | Diamond | 80 – 100|
