# Realtime Module

Socket.IO gateway that pushes tip and notification events to connected
clients. See `src/realtime/`.

## Connecting

Clients authenticate on the handshake, not via a separate event:

```ts
import { io } from 'socket.io-client'

const socket = io(API_URL, {
  auth: { token: accessToken }, // the same access token used for REST calls
  transports: ['websocket'],
})

socket.on('connected', ({ userId }) => {
  /* handshake accepted */
})
socket.on('auth.expired', ({ code, message }) => {
  /* refresh, then reconnect */
})
socket.on('error', ({ code, message }) => {
  /* FORBIDDEN, RATE_LIMITED, ... */
})
```

A connection with a missing or invalid token is rejected before `connection`
fires — the client only sees `connect_error`.

The server retains the verified JWT expiry for each accepted socket. When the
token expires, it emits `auth.expired` with the machine-readable code
`AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED`, then disconnects the socket. Socket.IO reports the
subsequent transport reason as `io server disconnect`; use the preceding
`auth.expired` event to distinguish auth expiry from ordinary disconnects.

## Event contract

The full typed contract lives in `types.ts` (`ServerToClientEvents`,
`ClientToServerEvents`). Summary:

- **Client → server:** `subscribe:creator`, `subscribe:notifications`,
  `subscribe:leaderboard`, `unsubscribe:creator`, `unsubscribe:notifications`,
  `unsubscribe:leaderboard`
- **Server → client:** `connected`, `auth.expired`, `error`, `tip.created`,
  `notification.created`, `balance.updated`,
  `leaderboard.updated`

Subscribing to another user's `notifications` room or another creator's
private room is rejected with an `error` event (`code: 'FORBIDDEN'`). A socket
may only subscribe to its own `user:<userId>` room and to the `creator:*` room
matching its authenticated Stellar address.

`subscribe:leaderboard` is explicitly public to authenticated sockets.

### leaderboard.updated

Broadcast to every socket in the public `leaderboard` room whenever a
confirmed tip changes a creator's rank (emitted from the tip confirmation
flow — see `modules/tips/tips.controller.ts`). Best-effort: a failure to
compute the new rank never blocks the tip confirmation response.

```ts
socket.emit('subscribe:leaderboard')
socket.on('leaderboard.updated', ({ window, entry }) => {
  // entry: { rank, userId, stellarAddress, totalTips }
})
```

## Heartbeat

The server pings each client on a fixed interval and disconnects it if no
pong is received within the timeout (configured in `gateway.ts`):

- `pingInterval`: 25s — how often the server probes the connection
- `pingTimeout`: 20s — how long it waits for a response before dropping it

These are handled by Socket.IO's engine (no application code needed) and
detect dead connections (e.g. a laptop going to sleep or a dropped Wi-Fi
network) faster than waiting on a TCP timeout.

## Reconnection

`socket.io-client` reconnects automatically by default (exponential backoff,
capped, with jitter). Important behavior to build clients against:

- **Rooms are not restored automatically.** On `reconnect`, re-issue
  `subscribe:creator` / `subscribe:notifications` for anything the client
  still cares about — the server has no memory of a socket's prior rooms
  once it disconnects.
- **The auth token is re-sent on every reconnect attempt** (it's read from
  the `auth` option passed to `io(...)`, not cached per-connection). If the
  token expires while offline, refresh it before the client comes back
  online so reconnection doesn't loop into `connect_error`.
- **Auth-expiry disconnects require an explicit reconnect.** Socket.IO does
  not automatically reconnect after the server calls `disconnect()`. On
  `auth.expired`, refresh the access token, update `socket.auth`, and call
  `socket.connect()` after randomized client-side delay. Use full jitter (for
  example, a random delay from 1–5 seconds) so simultaneous token expiry does
  not create a reconnect storm. Never reconnect with the expired token.
- Recommended client wiring:

```ts
socket.on('auth.expired', async ({ code }) => {
  if (code !== 'AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED') return

  const accessToken = await refreshAccessToken()
  socket.auth = { token: accessToken }
  const jitterMs = 1_000 + Math.random() * 4_000
  setTimeout(() => socket.connect(), jitterMs)
})

socket.on('reconnect', () => {
  socket.emit('subscribe:notifications', currentUserId)
  socket.emit('subscribe:creator', watchedCreatorAddress)
})
```

## Rate limiting

Realtime rate limiting protects against connection and message flooding (see `rateLimit.ts`):

- **Connections per IP:** 20 new connections per IP per 60s window, enforced as a
  handshake middleware before auth runs.
- **Connections per User:** 10 new connections per authenticated user per 60s window,
  enforced as a handshake middleware after auth runs.
- **Inbound Events:** 30 client→server events per socket per 10s window, enforced
  across all inbound event types via incoming packet middleware.
- **Redis-Backed Enforcement:** When `REALTIME_REDIS_ADAPTER_ENABLED=true`, connection
  and event quotas are tracked in Redis (`rl:rt:*`) so limits hold across horizontally
  scaled server instances. When disabled, an in-memory fallback is used.
- **Repeated Violations & Temporary Ban:** Sockets that repeatedly exceed event rate limits
  (5 violations within 60s) emit an error (`code: 'BANNED'`), are disconnected, and their
  IP and user ID are temporarily banned for 60 seconds. Subsequent connection attempts during
  the ban are rejected at handshake.

Exceeding connection limits rejects the handshake (`connect_error`).
Exceeding the event limit emits `error` (`code: 'RATE_LIMITED'`) and drops
that event; the socket stays connected until the repeated violation threshold is reached.

## Horizontal scaling (Redis adapter)

Rooms (`creator:*`, `user:*`, `leaderboard`) only exist in the memory of the
Socket.IO instance a socket connected to. Running more than one backend
instance requires the [`@socket.io/redis-adapter`](https://socket.io/docs/v4/redis-adapter/)
so an `emit*` call on one instance reaches sockets connected to another.

`initRealtime` attaches the adapter automatically using two dedicated
connections duplicated from the shared `ioredis` client (`src/db/redis.js`) —
a pub/sub subscriber can't issue other Redis commands on the same connection,
so a plain client can't be reused here.

Controlled by `REALTIME_REDIS_ADAPTER_ENABLED` (see `.env.example`):

- `true` (default) — attach the adapter. Required once more than one backend
  instance is running behind a load balancer.
- `false` — skip it, e.g. for a single-instance local dev setup. The test
  suite sets this to `false` (see `vitest.setup.ts`) so tests don't need a
  live Redis pub/sub connection.
